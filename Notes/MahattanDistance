Manhattan distance is a metric used to determine the distance between two points in a grid-like path.
Unlike Euclidean distance, which measures the shortest possible line between two points,
Manhattan distance measures the sum of the absolute differences between the coordinates of the points. This method is called "Manhattan distance" because, like a taxi driving through the grid-like streets of Manhattan, it must travel along the grid lines.

Mathematically, the Manhattan distance between two points in an n-dimensional space is the
sum of the absolute differences of their Cartesian coordinates.

2D example
Consider two points: A(1, 1) and B(4, 5):

Calculate |x₁ - x₂| = |1 - 4| = 3
Calculate |y₁ - y₂| = |1 - 5| = 4
Sum the results: 3 + 4 = 7

3D example
Now, let's consider two points in 3D space: A(1, 2, 3) and B(4, 5, 6):

Calculate |x₁ - x₂| = |1 - 4| = 3
Calculate |y₁ - y₂| = |2 - 5| = 3
Calculate |z₁ - z₂| = |3 - 6| = 3
Sum the results: 3 + 3 + 3 = 9

Comparison with Euclidean distance
While Manhattan distance measures the path along grid lines, Euclidean distance measures the straight-line distance between two points or, "as the crow flies," as they say.

For our 2D example:

Manhattan distance: 7 units
Euclidean distance: √((1-4)² + (1-5)²) = 5 units
