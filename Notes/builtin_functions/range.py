
# range(start, stop, step) generates a sequence of numbers starting from start, ending before stop, incremented by step.
# Here:
# start = 2: We start with the first even number.
# stop = n + 1: We include all numbers up to and including
# 𝑛
# n (Python's range excludes the stop value).
# step = 2: We increment by 2 to get all even numbers.
# Example
# range(2, 6 + 1, 2) → [2, 4, 6]
