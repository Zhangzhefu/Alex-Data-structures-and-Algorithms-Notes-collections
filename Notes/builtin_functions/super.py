# The super() function in Python is used to call methods from a parent (or superclass) class. It is particularly
# useful in the context of inheritance, where you have a child class that inherits from a parent class.
#
# The super() function helps you access methods and properties of the parent class, ensuring that the parent class is
# properly initialized and its methods are called.
