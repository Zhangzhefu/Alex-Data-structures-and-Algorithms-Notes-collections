Normally, float() is used to create a decimal number (e.g., float(3) -> 3.0).

However, when you use float('inf'), Python creates a special floating-point value that represents positive infinity (∞).

Why Does float('inf') Work?
Python follows the IEEE 754 standard for floating-point arithmetic, where:

float('inf') represents positive infinity (∞).

float('-inf') represents negative infinity (-∞)."""
