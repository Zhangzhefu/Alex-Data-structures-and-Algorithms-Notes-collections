# The enumerate()
#
# Iterable: The function takes an iterable (like a list, tuple, or string) as its first argument.
# 
# Index: It returns pairs of (index, item) for each item in the iterable.
#
# Optional Start: You can also specify a starting index. By default, it starts at 0.
#
# Simplifies Looping: enumerate() simplifies the process of iterating with a counter.
#
# Readability: It makes your code more readable by avoiding the need to manually manage a counter variable.
#
# Flexibility: You can start the counter from any number you prefer by using the start parameter.
#
# The enumerate() function is an excellent tool for making your loops more Pythonic and easier to understand.
